when you first clone, use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` to install the expo dependencies (i think)

then...

to run linter: `yarn lint`

to run tests: `yarn test`

to run: `yarn ios` or `yarn android`

## commit messages

Whenever you commit, husky runs the linter and tests automatically to ensure that all tests pass. You commit message should also be in the format `{type}: {message}`, where type is one of `[build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test]`
